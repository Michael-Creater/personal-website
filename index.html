  <h3> Background info </h3>
  <p> There's no limit to what the human mind can do if you set your mind to it. 
    Many bad and quite unfortunate things may happen in the course of our lifes but perseverance and looking ahead to better times help us to face them 
    Infact, sometimes the bad things happen so we can discover in ourselves what we didn't know we had before. </p>

  <h3>  DREAMS </h3>
   <h4> Journey </h4>
   <p>Due to the rather unfortunate and disturbing pandemic which i assume you may have heard of if you're not living under a rock,I had much time on my
   hands and i have learnt to play the piano quite nicely and learnt to program in Python and also web development which enabled me to build this page.
   It has been hard but occupying my mind with these things enabled me to beat boredom.
   But,i do not even want to pursue full time web development though i think its fun,quite ironically i want to be a full stack web developer and programmer and these skills might come handy and enable me to be the 
   best version of myself and i know with hardwork,determination and the favor of God,I'll make it.</p>
